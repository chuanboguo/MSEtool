# Foreword

MSEtool development is funded by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans and benefits from ongoing collaborations with the Natural Resources Defense Council and number of Canadian government scientists including Robyn Forrest, Sean Anderson and Daniel Duplisea. 

The package uses the Management Strategy Evaluation engine of [DLMtool](http://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org) to undertake closed-loop simulation testing of management procedures. The DLMtool package was developed at the University of British Columbia in collaboration with the Natural Resources Defense Council. 

DLMtool development has been funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Packard Foundation, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Walton Foundation, Resources Legacy Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

# Introduction

The MSEtool package is an extension of the DLMtool R package for implementing management strategy evaluation (MSE) simulations. Whereas DLMtool is primarily designed for testing data-limited management procedures, MSEtool provides an object-oriented framework for testing data-rich management procedures (MPs), which typically involve combining an assessment model with a harvest control rule to provide a fishery management recommendation. MSEtool management procedures are designed to be used with the operating model of DLMtool through the `runMSE` function. The user guide to the DLMtool package is accessible via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DLMtool::userguide()
```

The overall structure of a closed-loop simulation for a MSE in DLMtool can be described through the classes deployed in the package. An operating model (class __OM__ object) parameterizes the stock (biology), fleet, observation, and implementation dynamics of the MSE. To begin the MSE, the __OM__ object generates the data to be used for a management procedure and stores them in an object of class __Data__. A function of class __MP__ uses the __Data__ object and returns an object of class __Rec__ containing the management recommendations, e.g., effort and/or catch limits. From the management recommendations, the __OM__ object is updated and the process is successively repeated. The output for the closed-loop simulation is returned in an object of class __MSE__.

## Overview of MSEtool

To facilitate a standardized design for data-rich MPs, MSEtool builds out the __MP__ class with constituent functions of class __Assess__ and __HCR__. An __MP__ can be made from these functions to be tested in a MSE within the DLMtool framework. 

Additionally, __Assess__ functions can be used in an assessment-only context (external to management strategy evaluations). Output of an __Assess__ function can be used to provide standardized stock assessment reporting and diagnostics, such as Kobe plots, likelihood profiles for parameter estimates, and retrospective analyses of time series estimates of biomass, fishing mortality, recruitment, etc.

Separate functions are also available for standardized reporting of output from assessment models in a stock assessment setting._


### Additional features
MSEtool provides functions for converting the results of assessment models into DLMtool __OM__ and __Data__ objects. The `SS2OM` and `SS2Data` functions convert SS (Stock Synthesis) assessments, while `iSCAM2OM` and `iSCAM2Data` functions are provided for iSCAM assessments. 

To support multiple-area operating models, the `simmov` function estimates the movement matrix based on the prescribed number of areas, biomass distribution among areas in unfished conditions, and the probability of staying in each area.


# Assessment models

Assessment models in MSEtool are functions of class __Assess__. 
Currently, six assessment functions are available: `DD_TMB` (Delay-Difference model and its state-space counterpart, `DD_SS`), `SP` (Surplus Production model and its state-space counterpart, `SP_SS`), and `SCA` (Statistical Catch at age model and another variant `SCA2`). These functions take a __Data__ object as an argument and return an object of class __Assessment__, for example,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DD_result <- DD_TMB(Data = Red_snapper, ...)
```
where `...` are model configuration arguments.

The __Assessment__ object contains the raw output from TMB estimation model, optimization output from `nlminb`, and parameter estimates with covariance matrix (slots obj, opt, and SD, respectively). If applicable, time series estimates of total biomass, vulnerable biomass, spawning stock biomass, fishing mortality and/or exploitation rate, as well as their corresponding MSY and virgin reference points. The __Assess__ object also reports likelihood values and predicted values for the data used in the assessment model.

Descriptions of the __Assess__ functions are provided in a separate Appendix vignette:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("Assessment", package = "MSEtool")
```

## Reporting and diagnostic functions

Assessment results and summary, along with diagnostic procedures are available for each assessment model. Generic functions `summary` and `plot` are available for __Assessment__ objects. The `summary` function returns a list of estimated current stock status ($F/F_{MSY}$ , $B/B_{MSY}$ in the terminal year), input parameters to the model, derived quantities, and parameter estimates. The `plot` function generates time series figures of data, fitted data, and estimated quantities (e.g., biomass and recruitment). By default, these figures are save to disk and can be viewed with a HTML webpage generated by the function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(DD_result)
plot(DD_result, save_figure = TRUE, save_dir = getwd()) # By default, also saves figures in the working directory and HTML browser for future viewing
```

Two diagnostic functions are available: `retrospective` for retrospective analyses (re-running the model by sequentially removing terminal years of data) and `profile_likelihood` for profiling the likelihood function over a grid of parameters.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
retrospective(DD_result, nyr = 5) # Retrospective analysis going back 5 years from current year
profile_likelihood(DD_result, R0 = seq(0.75, 1.25, 0.025), h = seq(0.95, 1, 2.5e-3)) # Joint profile over grid of R0 and steepness
```

_Figure 3: Joint profile of R0 and steepness from Delay-Difference assessment model (DD_TMB function). Contours indicate change in likelihood values from minimum (red point)._

# Harvest control rules (HCRs)

Harvest control rules in MSEtool are functions of class __HCR__, and are designed to provide different for a given assessment model. __HCR__ functions take an object of class __Assessment__ and return an object of class __Rec__. Currently, three __HCR__ functions are available as output controls (catch limits): HCR_MSY, HCR40_10, and HCR60_20. HCR_MSY prescribes the TAC to be the catch predicted with fishing at the estimated $F_{MSY}$, i.e., the product of $F_{MSY}$ and estimated vulnerable biomass, while HCR40_10 and HCR60_20 are ramped control rules which reduce the $F_{MSY}$ catch limit based on spawning depletion $SSB/SSB[0]$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
par(mar = c(5,5,3,1))
Brel <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 200)
plot(Brel, MSEtool::HCRlin(Brel, 0.1, 0.4), xlab = expression(Estimated~~SSB/SSB[0]), ylab = "TAC adjustment factor \n(proportion of FMSY catch)", main = "40-10 harvest control rule", type = "l", col = "blue")
abline(v = c(0.1, 0.4), col = "red", lty = 2)
```

_Figure 4: The 40-10 harvest control rule prescribes an additional reduction in the TAC based on estimated spawning depletion._

# Creating MPs from assessments and HCRs

The `make_MP` function is a convenient way to stitch together a MP from an assessment model and HCR. The resulting function can then be passed to `DLMtool::runMSE()` for a management procedure.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DD_MSY <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY, ...)
DD_4010 <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR40_10)
myMSE <- DLMtool::runMSE(OM = DLMtool::testOM, MPs = c("FMSYref", "DD_MSY", "DD_4010"))
Tplot2(myMSE)
```

<img src="DD_MSE.png">

_Figure 5. Trade-off plot of the MSE for the MPs that use the Delay-Difference model with two harvest control rules and the FMSY reference MP._

Model configuration arguments can be passed through `...` in `make_MP` when the MP is made. For example, the Ricker stock-recruitment relationship can be used in the Delay-Difference model instead of the default Beverton-Holt relationship with argument `SR = "Ricker"`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DD_MSY_Ricker <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY, SR = "Ricker")
```

This MP will call `DD_TMB(SR = "Ricker")`.

## Diagnostic of assessment models in MSE

By default, assessment model results are not saved during the MSE. However, this feature can be turned on with argument `diagnostic = TRUE` in `make_MP`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DD_MSY <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY, diagnostic = TRUE)
```


For each MP, two diagnostic objects are saved and reported in the `DLMtool::DLMenv` environment: the system time needed to run each assessment call and the __Assessment__ objects from each assessment call. The timing information may be useful to estimate total run time for additional MSE simulations or identify iterations in which the model has trouble with convergence. The __Assessment__ objects are used to obtain convergence information, as well as retrospective estimates of biomass and mortality over successive applications.

Currently, this feature is memory-intensive and may cause performance issues or crashes. If the MSE is crashing with large number of simulations, a solution may be to run `DLMtool::runMSE()` in several batches with different seed numbers. MSE performance over all batches can be calculated by stitching the class __MSE__ objects together with `DLMtool::joinMSE()`.

The `diagnosic_AM` function plots the timing and convergence information, and `retrospective_AM` plots the assessment model's retrospective patterns (for a single simulation in the MSE).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DD_MSY <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY, diagnostic = TRUE)
myMSE <- DLMtool::runMSE(OM = DLMtool::testOM, MPs = c("FMSYref", "DD_MSY", "DD_4010"))
diagnostic_AM(myMSE)
retrospective_AM(myMSE, sim = 1, MP = "DD_MSY")
```

Colored lines indicate model estimates sequentially over the projection years. Note that this assessment model assumes the vulnerable biomass to be the spawning biomass._

## Obtaining management recommendations

Like all other output MPs, `DLMtool::TAC()` can be used to obtain a catch limit:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
DD_MSY <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY)
snapper_TAC <- TAC(Red_snapper, MPs = c("DD_MSY", "DD_4010"))
plot(snapper_TAC)
```
