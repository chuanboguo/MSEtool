\title{State-space surplus production model with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters}
\usage{
SP_SS(x, Data, reps = 100, n = 2, B1frac = 1, Assessment = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation}

\item{n}{The exponent of the production function, which is fixed in the model.
Typically fixed at n = 2, where the biomass at MSY is half of carrying capacity.}

\item{B1frac}{The biomass to carrying capacity ratio in the first year of the model.
A value of 1 assumes virgin conditions.}

\item{Assessment}{Indicates whether variables and assessment results will be produced from MP.}

\item{report}{Indicates whether report will be produced for Data object.}
}
\value{
If \code{Assessment = TRUE}, an object of class \code{Assessment}.
Otherwise, an object of class \code{Rec}.
}
\description{
A state-space surplus production model that estimates annual deviates in biomass.
The model uses time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB.
The model is conditioned on catch and estimates a predicted index.
}
\note{
The model is parameterized with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters.
Virgin conditions are assumed in the first year of the time series and
the production function is assumed to be symmetric.
