\title{State-space surplus production model with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters}
\usage{
SP_SS(x = 1, Data, n = 2, Binit_frac = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An index for the objects in \code{Data} when running in closed loop simulation.
Otherwise, equals to 1 When running an assessment interactively.}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{n}{The exponent of the production function (fixed in the model).
Typically fixed at \code{n = 2}, where the biomass at MSY is half of carrying capacity.}

\item{Binit_frac}{The ratio of biomass to carrying capacity in the first year
(fixed in the model). A value of 1 assumes virgin conditions.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\linkS4class{Assessment}} containing objects and output
from TMB.
}
\description{
A state-space surplus production model that estimates annual deviates in biomass.
The model uses time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB.
The model is conditioned on catch and estimates a predicted index.
}
\note{
The model uses the Fletcher (1978) formulation and is parameterized with UMSY and MSY as
leading parameters. The default conditions assume virgin conditions in the first year of the time series
and a symmetric production function.
