\title{Calculates movement matrices from user inputs}
\usage{
simmov(OM, dist = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), prob = 0.5, distE = 0.1,
  probE = 0.1, prob2 = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{Operating model, an object of class \linkS4class{OM}.}

\item{dist}{A vector of length \code{nareas} of fractions of unfished stock in each area}

\item{prob}{Mean probability of staying across all areas (single value) or a vector of the probability of individuals staying in each area (same length as dist)}

\item{distE}{Logit (normal) St.Dev error for sampling stock fractions from the fracs vector}

\item{probE}{Logit (normal) St.Dev error for sampling desired probability of staying either by area (prob is same length as dist) or the mean probability of staying (prob is a single number)}

\item{prob2}{Optional vector as long as prob and dist. Upper bounds on uniform sampling of probability of staying, lower bound is prob.}
}
\value{
The operating model \code{OM} with movement parameters in slot \code{cpars}.
The \code{mov} array is of dimension \code{nsim}, \code{maxage}, \code{nareas}, \code{nareas}.
}
\description{
A function for calculating a movement matrix from user specified unfished stock biomass fraction in each area

\examples{
movOM_5areas<-simmov(testOM,dist=c(0.01,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.39),prob=c(0.1,0.6,0.6,0.7,0.9))
movOM_5areas@cpars$mov[1,1,,] # sim 1, age 1, movement from areas to areas
