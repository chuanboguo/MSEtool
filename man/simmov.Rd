\title{Calculates movement matrices from user inputs}
\usage{
simmov(OM, dist = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), prob = 0.5, distE = 0.1,
  probE = 0.1, prob2 = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{A vector nareas long of fractions of unfished stock in each area}

\item{prob}{Mean probability of staying across all areas (single value) or a vector of the probability of individuals staying in each area (same length as dist)}

\item{distE}{A log error term for sampling stock fractions from the fracs vector}

\item{probE}{Logit (normal) error for sampling desired probability of staying either by area (prob is same length as dist) or the mean probability of staying (prob is a single number)}

\item{prob2}{Optional vector prob and dist long. Upper bounds on uniform sampling of probability of staying}
