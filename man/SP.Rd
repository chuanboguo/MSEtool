\title{Surplus production model with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters}
\usage{
SP(Data, n = 2, B1frac = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{n}{The exponent of the production function, which is fixed in the model.
Typically fixed at n = 2, where the biomass at MSY is half of carrying capacity.}

\item{B1frac}{The biomass to carrying capacity ratio in the first year of the model.
A value of 1 assumes virgin conditions.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\linkS4class{Assessment}} containing objects and output
from TMB.
}
\description{
A surplus production model that estimates the TAC using a
time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB.
The model is conditioned on catch and estimates a predicted index.
}
\note{
The model uses the Fletcher (1978) formulation and is parameterized with UMSY and MSY as
leading parameters. Virgin conditions are assumed in the first year of the time series and
the production function is assumed to be symmetric.
