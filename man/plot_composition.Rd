\title{Plot composition data}
\usage{
plot_composition(Year, obs, fit = NULL, plot_type = c("annual", "bubble",
  "mean"), data_type = c(NULL, "length", "age"), CAL_bins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Year}{A vector of years.}

\item{obs}{A matrix of either length or age composition data. For lengths, rows and columns
should index years and length bin, respectively. For ages, rows and columns should index
years and age, respectively.}

\item{fit}{A matrix of predicted length or age composition from an assessment model.
Same dimensions as obs.}

\item{plot_type}{Indicates which plots to create. Options include annual distributions,
bubble plot, and annual means.}

\item{data_type}{Indicates whether length or age data are being used.}

\item{CAL_bins}{A vector of lengths corresponding to the columns in \code{obs}
and \code{fit}. Ignored for age data.}
}
\value{
Plots depending on \code{plot_type}.
}
\description{
Plots annual length or age composition data.
