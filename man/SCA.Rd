\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the Data object (by default, equal to one for
assessments).}

\item{Data}{An object of class Data.}

year of model. \code{"virgin"} fixes \code{U = 0} prior to year 1 while \code{"est"} will
estimate it.}

\item{vulnerability}{Whether estimated vulnerability is logistic or dome (double-normal).
See details for parameterization.}

\item{CAA_multiplier}{Numeric for data weighting of catch-at-age matrix. See details.}

\item{start}{Optional list of starting values. See details.}

\item{silent}{(TRUE/FALSE) Passed to \code{\link[TMB]{MakeADFun}}, whether TMB
will print trace information during optimization. Used for dignostics for model convergence.}

\item{control}{A named list of parameters regarding optimization to be passed to
\code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed.}

\description{
A generic statistical catch-at-age model. The parameterization by Forrest et al. (2008)
is used which generally results in faster convergence.
}
\details{
For the SCA model, the basic data inputs are catch (by weight), index
(by weight/biomass), and catch-at-age matrix (by numbers). Catches are
assumed to be known perfectly (the harvest rate in a given year is the ratio of the observed
catch to the vulnerable biomass at the beginning of the year), while the observation error
of the index is fixed based on the value of \code{CV_Ind} in the Data object.

The annual sample sizes of the catch-at-age matrix is provided to the model (used in the
likelihood for catch-at-age, assuming a multinomial distribution),
and is manipulated via argument \code{CAA_multiplier}. This argument is
interpreted in two different ways depending on the value provided.
If \code{CAA_multiplier > 1}, then this value will cap the annual sample sizes
to that number. If \code{CAA_multiplier <= 1}, then all the annual samples sizes
will be re-scaled by that number. By default, sample sizes are capped at 50.

Recruitment deviations are estimated beginning in the year when age composition are available.

Vulnerability can be specified to be either logistic or dome. If logistic, then the model
vector \code{vul_par} is of length 2, containing the ages of 50% and 95% vulnerability,
respectively. The age of 95% vulnerability is an offset, i.e.,
\code{vul_95 = vul_par[1] + exp(vul_par[2])}.

With dome vulnerability,

For \code{start}, a named list of starting values of estimates for:
\itemize{
\item \code{UMSY}
\item \code{MSY}
\item \code{U_equilibrium} (typically 0). See \code{U_begin} argument.
\item \code{vul_par} (length 2 vector for logistic or length 4 for dome).
\item \code{tau} the standard deviation of the log-recruitment deviations. The observation
error of the index is fixed based on the value of \code{CV_Ind} in the Data object, and
weighting of the catch-at-age is handled by argument \code{CAA_multiplier}.
}
}
\note{
Convergence problems may occur if perfect data are used (i.e., \code{Data@CV_Ind}
is very low).
