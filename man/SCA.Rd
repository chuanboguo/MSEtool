SCA(x = 1, Data, U_begin = c("virgin", "est"), CAA_multiplier = 100,

\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the Data object (by default, equal to one for
assessments).}

\item{Data}{An object of class Data.}

\item{U_begin}{Indicates how to handle the equilibrium harvest rate prior to the first
year of model. \code{"virgin"} fixes \code{U = 0} prior to year 1 while \code{"est"} will
estimate it.}

\item{CAA_multiplier}{Numeric for data weighting of catch-at-age matrix. See details.}

\item{start}{Optional list of starting values. See details.}

\item{silent}{(TRUE/FALSE) Whether TMB should print output. Used for dignostics.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed.}

An object of class \linkS4class{Assessment}.

\description{
Statistical catch-at-age (SCA) model with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters
}
\details{
For the SCA model, the basic data inputs are catch (by weight), index
(by weight/biomass), and catch-at-age matrix (by numbers). Catches are
assumed to be known perfectly (the harvest rate in a given year is the ratio of the observed
catch to the vulnerable biomass at the beginning of the year), while the observation error
of the index is fixed based on the value of \code{CV_Ind} in the Data object.

The annual sample sizes of the catch-at-age matrix is provided to the model (used in the
likelihood for catch-at-age, assuming a multinomial distribution),
and is manipulated via argument \code{CAA_multiplier}. This argument is
interpreted in two different ways depending on the value provided.
If \code{CAA_multiplier > 1}, then this value will cap the annual sample sizes
to that number. If \code{CAA_multiplier <= 1}, then all the annual samples sizes
will be re-scaled by that number. By default, sample sizes are capped at 100.
