\title{State-Space Delay-Difference Stock Assessment in TMB with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters}
\usage{
DD_SS(x, Data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An index for the objects in \code{Data} when running in closed loop simulation.
Otherwise, equals to 1 When running an assessment interactively.}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\linkS4class{Assessment}} containing objects and output
from TMB.
}
\description{
A delay-difference assessment that estimates the TAC using a
time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB.
Recruitment deviations from the stock-recruit relationship are estimated as a
state space variable. The model is conditioned on effort and estimates
predicted catch.
}
\note{
Similar to many other assessment
models it depends on assumptions such as stationary productivity and
proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance.
Unsurprisingly the extent to which these assumptions are
violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method.
The observation error standard deviation is fixed according to the
presumed CV of the catch and the process error (recruitment) standard deviation
is estimated.
