\title{diagnostic_AM (diagnostic of Assessments in MSE): Did Assess models converge during MSE?}
\usage{
diagnostic_AM(MSE, DLMenv = DLMtool::DLMenv, gradient_threshold = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSE}{An object of class MSE created by \code{\link[DLMtool]{runMSE}}.}

\item{DLMenv}{The name of the environment that contains the Assessment output
generated during the MSE.}

\item{gradient_threshold}{The value of the maximum gradient magnitude below which the
model is considered to have converged.}
}
\value{
Figure. Traffic light (red/green) plots indicating whether model converged,
according to \code{convergence} code in list returned by \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}
the Hessian matrix is positive-definite, according to \code{pdHess} in
list returned by \code{\link[TMB]{sdreport}}, and the maximum gradient magnitude is
below \code{gradient_threshold}. Model run time during all simulations if the
model was timed in the management procedure.
}
\description{
Diagnostic check for convergence of Assess models converge during MSE.
Assess models write output to the DLMenv environement if their argument
\code{diagnostic = TRUE}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
DD_MSY <- makeMP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY, diagnostic = TRUE) # is FALSE by default
show(DD_MSY)
myMSE <- DLMtool::runMSE(DLMtool::testOM, MPs = "DD_MSY")
diagnostic_AM(myMSE)

ls(DLMtool::DLMenv) # Assessment output and diagnostics are located here

# Save to disk for future use. File may be very large due to size of DLMenv!
save(myMSE, DLMenv, myMSE_hist, file = "DLMenv.RData")
