\title{A 40-10 harvest control rule.}
\usage{
HCR40_10(x = 1, Assessment, reps = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Assessment}{An object of class \linkS4class{Assessment}.}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation.}

\item{...}{Miscellaneous arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{Rec} with the TAC recommendation.
}
\description{
A output control rule with a ramp that reduces the
TAC recommendation (FMSY * Biomass) when biomass depletion (B/B0) is less than 40%.
The TAC reduction is linearly reduced to 0 when depletion is less than 10%.
}
\examples{
# 40-10 linear ramp
Brel <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 200)
plot(Brel, HCRlin(Brel, 0.1, 0.4), xlab = "Estimated B/B0", ylab = "TAC adjustement factor",
main = "A 40-10 harvest control rule", type = "l", col = "blue")
abline(v = c(0.1,0.4), col = "red", lty = 2)

# create an MP to run in closed-loop MSE
DD_40_10 <- make_MP(DD_TMB, HCR40_10)
\dontrun{
myOM <- DLMtool::runMSE(DLMtool::testOM, MPs = c("FMSYref", "DD_40_10"))
