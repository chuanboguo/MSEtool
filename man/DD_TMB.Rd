\title{Delay - Difference Stock Assessment in TMB with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters}
\usage{
DD_TMB(x, Data, start = NULL, silent = TRUE, ...)

DD_SS(x, Data, start = NULL, silent = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An index for the objects in \code{Data} when running in closed loop simulation.
Otherwise, equals to 1 when running an assessment.}

\item{Data}{An object of class \linkS4class{Data}.}

\item{start}{Optional list of starting values. See details.}

\item{silent}{(TRUE/FALSE) Whether tracing information is provided by TMB during
optimization. Used to aid convergence, help with diagnostics.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\linkS4class{Assessment}} containing objects and output
from TMB.
}
\description{
A simple delay-difference assessment that estimates the TAC using a
time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB. The model
is conditioned on effort and estimates predicted catch. In the state-space version,
recruitment deviations from the stock-recruit relationship are estimated as a
random effect variable.
}
\details{
To provide starting values for the model, a named list can be provided for \code{UMSY},
\code{MSY}, and \code{q} via the \code{start} argument (see example).

For \code{DD_SS}, a start value can also be provided for \code{tau}, the standard
deviation of the recruitment variability. The catch standard deviation is fixed based
on the value of \code{Data@CV_Cat}.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{DD_TMB}: Observation-error only model

\item \code{DD_SS}: State-Space version of Delay-Difference model
}}

\note{
Similar to many other assessment
models, the model depends on assumptions such as stationary productivity and
proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance.
Unsurprisingly the extent to which these assumptions are
violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method.

\examples{
data(sim_snapper)

#### Observation-error delay difference model
res <- DD_TMB(1, sim_snapper)

### State-space version
res <- DD_SS(1, sim_snapper)

# Provide starting values
start <- list(UMSY = 0.05, MSY = 4, q = 0.3, tau = 0.5)
res <- DD_TMB(1, sim_snapper, start = start)

summary(res@SD) # Look at parameter estimates
