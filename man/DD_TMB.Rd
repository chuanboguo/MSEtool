\title{Delay - Difference Stock Assessment in TMB with UMSY and MSY as leading parameters}
\usage{
DD_TMB(x, Data, reps = 100, report = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation}

\item{report}{Indicates whether report will be produced for Data object.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of TAC recommendations. If \code{report = TRUE}, a list of
model and TAC output is returned.
}
\description{
A simple delay-difference assessment that estimates the TAC using a
time-series of catches and a relative abundance index and coded in TMB. The model
is conditioned on effort and estimates predicted catch.
}
\note{
This DD model is observation error only and has does not estimate
process error (recruitment deviations). Similar to many other assessment
models it depends on assumptions such as stationary productivity and
proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance.
Unsurprisingly the extent to which these assumptions are
violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method.
