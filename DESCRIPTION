Description: An extension of DLMtool which provides simulation tools for management strategy evaluation
  informing data-rich fisheries. Using the DLMtool operating model, MSEtool provides complementary assessment models of
  varying complexity with standardized reporting, diagnostic tools for evaluating assessment models within closed-loop
  simulation, and helper functions for building more complex operating models and management procedures.
